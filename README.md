## Hey there 👋

I'm Henry, a front-end developer based in London.

While I do mostly work on front-end stuff, I'm learning backend in hopes to create a fullstack AI tutoring app.

My main languages are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I'm pretty good at Java too. I'm currently learning JavaScript and CSS, along with Python.

On this profile, I mainly just create mini projects to help me learn, some of which contribute to my tutoring app (like my todo list and pomodoro timer, which you should go check out!)
